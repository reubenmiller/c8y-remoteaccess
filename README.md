# c8y-remoteaccess

:warning: Usage of this extension is discouraged as it will be incorporated natively in go-c8y-cli soon. In addition the integration will also support a new c8ylp replacement to natively create a local proxy connection to the device (e.g. with ssh etc.). You can track the progress here: https://github.com/reubenmiller/go-c8y-cli/pull/368
